COPY/ADD
============
COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve similar purposes. They let you copy files from a specific location into a 
Docker image.
COPY takes in a src and destination. It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker 
image) into the Docker image itself.
ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. Secondly, 
you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.
