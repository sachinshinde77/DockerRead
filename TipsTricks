COPY/ADD
============
COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve similar purposes. They let you copy files from a specific location into a 
Docker image.
COPY takes in a src and destination. It only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host (the machine building the Docker 
image) into the Docker image itself.
ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources. First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory. Secondly, 
you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.

Port Expose vs Publish
=========================
To lists all port mappings or a specific mapping for a Docker container
  #docker port <CONTAINER_NAME>

EXPOSE tells Docker the running container listens on specific network ports. This acts as a kind of port mapping documentation that 
can then be used when publishing the ports.
  #dockerfile
    EXPOSE <port> [<port>/<protocol>...]
  #via cmd line
    docker run --expose=1234 my_app

EXPOSE will not allow communication via the defined ports to containers outside of the same network or to the host machine. To allow 
this to happen you need to PUBLISH the ports.

Publish ports and map them to the host
  To actually publish the port when running the container, use the -p flag on docker run to publish and map one or more ports, or the 
-P flag to publish all exposed ports and map them to high-order ports.

    docker run -p 80:80/tcp -p 80:80/udp my_app
    -p flag is the host port, and the second is the container port.

DOCKER COMPOSE expose vs ports
  Like EXPOSE in a Dockerfile, this instruction is used to expose ports without publishing them to the host machine — they’ll only
be accessible to linked services on the same network.
expose:
 - "3000"
 - "8000"

ports
This is used to publish ports to a host. You can either use a short syntax, or give a more detailed configuration.
Either specify both ports (HOST:CONTAINER), or just the container port (an ephemeral host port is chosen).

ports:
 - "3000"
 - "8000:8000/tcp"
 - "127.0.0.1:8001:8001"

The long form syntax allows the configuration of additional fields that can’t be expressed in the short form.
target: the port inside the container
published: the publicly exposed port
protocol: the port protocol (tcp or udp)
mode: host for publishing a host port on each node, or ingress for a swarm mode port to be load balanced.
ports:
  - target: 80
    published: 8080
    protocol: tcp
    mode: host
